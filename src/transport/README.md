# uProtocol Transport Interface & Data Model

## Overview

The purpose of this moduel is to provide the Java implementation of [uTransport API & Data Model](https://github.com/eclipse-uprotocol/uprotocol-spec/blob/main/up-l1/README.adoc). The transport API is used by all uE developers to send and receive messages across any transport. The interface is to be implemented by communication transport developers (i.e. developing a uTransport for SOME/IP, DDS, Zenoh, MQTT, etc...).
