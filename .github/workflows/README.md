# Which automations do we run?

This file is meant to provide an overview and explainer on what the up-rust workflow automation strategy is, and what the different workflow elements do.

__A general note:__ All workflows will use the `stable` version of the Rust toolchain, unless the GitHub actions variable `RUST_TOOLCHAIN` is set to pin a specific Rust version (e.g. ```RUST_TOOLCHAIN=1.76.0```).

At this time, there are three events that will initiate a workflow run:

## PRs and merges to main

We want a comprehensive but also quick check&test workflow. This should be testing all relevant/obvious feature sets, run on all major OSes, and of course include all the Rust goodness around cargo check, fmt, clippy and so on.

This is implemented in [`check.yaml`](check.yaml)

## Release publication

We want exhaustive tests and all possible checks, as well as creation of license reports, collection of quality artifacts and publication to crates.io. This workflow pulls in other pieces like the build workflow. An actual release is triggered by pushing a tag that begins with 'v', else this workflow just generates and collects artifacts on workflow level. This will also publish to crates.io if the CRATES_TOKEN secret is set.

This is implemented in [`release.yaml`](release.yaml)

## Nightly, out of everyone's way

All the tests we can think of, however long they might take. For instance, we can build up-rust for different architectures - this might not really create many insights, but doesn't hurt to try either, and fits nicely into a nightly build schedule.

This is implemented in [`nightly.yaml`](nightly.yaml)

## Further workflow modules

In addition to the main workflows described above, there exist a number of modules that are used by these main workflows. They can also be run standalone, and are intendet to make composing the capabilities of our main workflows simpler. These are:

- [`coverage.yaml`](coverage.yaml) - collects test code coverage, and can optionally upload the results to codecov.io
  - Will publish coverage data to CodeCov if `${{ secrets.CODECOV_TOKEN }}` is set
  - outputs: download URL for the workflow-generated coverage info file
- [`license-report.yaml`](license-report.yaml) - create a license report for `up-rust` and all its dependencies in html format
  - outputs: download URL for the workflow-generated license report
- [`test-featurematrix.yaml`](test-featurematrix.yaml) - Test all feature combinations on a range of OS platforms
- [`verify-msrv.yaml`](verify-msrv.yaml) - checks if the MSRV ('Minimum Supported Rust Version) declared in Cargo.toml is correct
- [`x-build.yaml`](x-build.yaml) - Run release builds on multiple architecture targets
