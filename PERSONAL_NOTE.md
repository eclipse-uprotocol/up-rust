# Preamble

This is by far the majority of Rust code I've written in my life, as well as by far the most code I've written in many years. While I tried my best to be circumspect and mindful of how things are done in idiomatic Rust, at this point I'm certain I failed more often than I succeeded in that endeavor. When starting out with this port, I decided to port the Java SDK code instead of directly implementing the specification - because at that point, there was a lot more code than spec, and also because porting code is a good way to learn a language, and I wanted to begin to learn Rust.
I know that there are inconsistencies and possible improvements all over the place - this is a lot of code, and while working at one end my grasp of Rust changes, or the upstream changes, etc - I plan to work to streamline things going forward.
All of this boils down to a simple request: please be gentle and constructive with feedback, and improvements are welcome especially in the form of PRs!
