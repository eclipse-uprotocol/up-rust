## Eclipse Contributor Agreement

Before your contribution can be accepted by the project team contributors must
electronically sign the Eclipse Contributor Agreement (ECA).

Commits that are provided by non-committers must have a Signed-off-by field in
the footer indicating that the author is aware of the terms by which the
contribution has been provided to the project. The non-committer must
additionally have an Eclipse Foundation account and must have a signed Eclipse
Contributor Agreement (ECA) on file.

For more information, please see the Eclipse Committer Handbook:
<https://www.eclipse.org/projects/handbook/#resources-commit>

## Setting up a development environment

You can use any development environment you like to contribute to the uProtocol Rust SDK. However, it is mandatory to use the Rust linter ('[clippy](<https://github.com/rust-lang/rust-clippy>)') for any pull requests you do.
To set up VSCode to run clippy per default every time you save your code, have a look here: [How to use Clippy in VS Code with rust-analyzer?](https://users.rust-lang.org/t/how-to-use-clippy-in-vs-code-with-rust-analyzer/41881)

Similarly, the project requests that markdown is formatted and linted properly - to help with this, it is recommended to use [markdown linters](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=DavidAnson.vscode-markdownlint).
